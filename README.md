This repository contains the E-commerce food orders.

# Downloading code snapshots

You can download all the content of a branch via the "Code" button here on Github. You can then either clone the repository or simply download the selected branch content as a ZIP file.

Important: You always download the entire branch content!

You can then dive into the interesting folders (e.g. the individual code snapshots) locally on your hard drive.

## Running the attached code

You can use the attached code simply to compare it to yours. But you can also run it.

To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the cd command in your command prompt or terminal first.

Then run npm install to install all required dependencies (this will create a /node_modules folder).

```bash
$ npm install

$ npm start

```

For build files

```
$ npm run build
```

Important: If you're using the code for a module that requires API keys or a backend (e.g. the module about sending Http requests), you'll have to use your backend URLs or API keys. Mine won't work (I disabled my projects).
